# Montpesites

Self-hosted platform to build, test and deploy static web sites.

## How it works

Each platform instance provides an interface to build, test and deploy a website.

A development version of the website being build will be available in each instance under a subdomain. Once the website is ready for production, the user needs to connect his gitlab account to push the changes to a repository. The production vesion of the website will be hosted for free using gitlab pages, for example.
